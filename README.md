## Description

Book Nest is an app for book lovers. Book Nest is a charming community for those who love to read e-books. Readers can find their new favourite book. Book owners can share their e-books. Authors can share their stories. 

The application was designed following the [MVC (Model View Control)](https://www.educba.com/what-is-mvc-design-pattern/) design pattern using a MySQL database with Sequelize ORM, an Express.js back end, the Handlebars templating engine to present data to the user.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/book-nest) for the Book Nest app's code. See the deployed app on **[Heroku](TO DO)**.
